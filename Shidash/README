These are the config files and scripts needed to get my Tails install
running.

Note: I'm still working out some issues with development environment
setup and I need to tweak some of the firewall setting changes.

setup.sh: Initial setup on a fresh Tails install (with persistent volume)
boot.sh: Configuration on boot
utilities: Scripts for random utility functions
backup: Backup-related scripts
dotfiles: Config files
tahoeinstall.sh: Loads tahoe and then setup based on tahoe data

backupkeystodo.sh: Backs up frequently used files (must mount first)
backupall.sh: Backs up all files from flash drive (must mount first)
restoresetup.sh: Restores files needed for setup (must install tahoe first)
restoreall.sh: Makes a new flash drive with all files (must mount first)
