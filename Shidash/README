These are the config files and scripts needed to get my Tails install
running.

Note: I'm still working out some issues with development environment
setup and I need to tweak some of the firewall setting changes.

setup.sh: Initial setup on a fresh Tails install (with persistent volume)
boot.sh: Configuration on boot
utilities: Scripts for random utility functions
backup: Backup-related scripts
dotfiles: Config files
